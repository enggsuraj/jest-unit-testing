 ## What is Unit Testing 

⚡ Unit Testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. 

💻 The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. 

👨‍💻 Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers. 

✔ Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness. A unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object.

## Why Unit testing are important

🐞Unit tests help to fix bugs early in the development cycle and save costs.

🔥 It helps the developers to understand the code base and enables them to make changes quickly.

📘 Good unit tests serve as project documentation. 

🎫 Unit tests help with code re-use. Migrate both your code andyour tests to your new project. Tweak the code until the tests run again.

## About Jest 

🎭 Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

🎇 Jest aims to work out of the box, config free, on most JavaScript projects.

🎉 Make tests which keep track of large objects with ease. Snapshots live either alongside your tests, or embedded inline.

🎲 Tests are parallelized by running them in their own processes to maximize performance.
